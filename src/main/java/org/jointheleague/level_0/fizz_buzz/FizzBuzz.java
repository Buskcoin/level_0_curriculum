/**
 * Fizz Buzz
 * 
 * In this project, we're going to build FizzBuzz. It's a children's game where
 * you count from 1 to 20. Easy, right? Here's the catch: instead of saying
 * numbers divisible by 3, say "Fizz". And instead of saying numbers divisible
 * by 5, say "Buzz". For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz".
 * 
 * So the rules are:
 *         Any number divisible by 3 is replaced by the word fizz 
 *         Any number divisible by 5 is replaced by the word buzz. 
 *         Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 become fizzbuzz.
 * 
 * Print your results to the console, or using JOptionPane if you like.
