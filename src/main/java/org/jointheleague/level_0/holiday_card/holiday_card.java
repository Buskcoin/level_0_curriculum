Builds on Christmas Tree
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjgYszbYSoLXPdIcdnhR00ZrceeNhdd_j1XCPanAqig/edit	

We are going make Tortoise draw us a Christmas Tree. 
In fact, since it doesn’t seem to mind, we might get the Tortoise to draw us many Christmas Trees of different sizes. 
We’ll start drawing the tree at the top and work our way down.

You can try this yourself, or use the Christmas Tree recipe if you prefer.

We want to draw trees wherever the mouse was clicked. 
Paste your Christmas Tree code into the Holiday Card recipe. 
Be patient as it takes the Tortoise a while to draw the tree. It thinks it’s vacation time!

The recipe will help you to add music and a greeting to your card.

Use these instructions to export your card and send it to someone you love!
 
[ADVANCED] Adjust the size of the tree depending on it’s distance from the center of the screen. Complete the steps below before you call the drawTree() method.
    // Make a variable that holds the width of the tortoiseWindow
    // Make variable that holds the distance of the mouse from the center of the window.
    // Make sure that distance is always a positive number
    // Set tree width to the distance divided by 10
    // Set the pen width to treeWidth divided by 5
