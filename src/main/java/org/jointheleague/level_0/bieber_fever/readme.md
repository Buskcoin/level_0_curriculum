Bieber Fever Challenge

1: Write a program that uses a for loop to print 
    baby
    baby
    baby
    oh
   Code can only contain one “baby”, and one “oh”.


2: Every 2nd time the “oh” should be “no”


3: Each chorus ends with “I thought you'd always be mine”.


4: [Optional] Use the speak method from Stephen Hawking to speak the lyrics.
